# DodgeTheSquares
This was a game designed by me to practice using programming with classes in C#, and to practice RayLib.

The game's objective is to dodge the enemy squares and not get hit.
When you are hit, you will lose a life and points.
Run out of lives and it's game over!

Can you get the highscore?
