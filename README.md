# DodgeTheSquares

This is one of my first big personal projects to test my understanding of OOP in C#. The purpose of creating this is to gain more confidence in myself and what I have learned.

The game's objective is to dodge the enemy squares and not get hit.
When you are hit, you will lose a life and points.
Run out of lives and it's game over!

Can you get the highscore?

# Programming Objectives

This was a game designed by me to practice using programming with classes in C#, and to practice using the RayLib_cs library.
